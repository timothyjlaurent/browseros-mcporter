When the user invokes `/deepsearch` with a research objective, you MUST follow these steps IN ORDER:

1. **Decompose Research Objective**: Break the high-level research goal into structured sub-questions and executable tasks.
2. **Delegate to Subagents**: Assign specialized subagents to handle isolated research threads or domains.
3. **Aggregate and Analyze Context**: Collect findings across files, tools, and conversations while maintaining long-term context.
4. **Synthesize Insights**: Integrate results into a coherent, well-supported analysis or recommendation.
5. **Persist Knowledge**: Store key findings and decisions for reuse across future conversations and research threads.
